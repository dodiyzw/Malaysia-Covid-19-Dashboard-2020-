# Malaysia-Covid-19-Dashboard-2020-

This project was created when the government of Malaysia did not provide state-level COVID-19 data in a CSV format, and hence data were scrapped from daily press release. The dataset is no longer updated as the government now makes the dataset available.  

Dashboard was built using Plotly in Python.
